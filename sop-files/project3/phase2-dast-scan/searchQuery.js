/**
 * A small, deliberately naive parser for DocuTrust's document search
 * syntax (supports quoted phrases and a trailing wildcard, e.g.
 * `"quarterly report" budget*`). Written simply on purpose, this is
 * the actual fuzz target for Project 7 (Continuous Fuzzing), which
 * should find a real, serious bug here through coverage-guided input
 * generation, not by reading the code and guessing.
 *
 * Known-naive by design, not a bug report: an unclosed quote (e.g.
 * `"never closed`) causes indexOf to return -1, which sends `i` back
 * to 0 on the next loop iteration instead of advancing, an infinite
 * loop that pushes tokens forever and crashes the process with
 * unbounded memory growth, a real denial-of-service bug reachable from
 * a single malformed search request. This is exactly the class of bug
 * fuzzing exists to catch and manual review commonly misses. Project 7's
 * job is to let the fuzzer find it for real, then fix it.
